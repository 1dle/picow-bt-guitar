# Pico W bluetooth guitar
Same as my other project: [esp32-ble-guitar](https://github.com/1dle/esp32-ble-guitar), but for Raspberry Pi Pico W platform. Reuse old Guitar Hero controllers to work with PC through Bluetooth.

Took inspiration from this repo: [PicoGamepadConverter](https://github.com/Loc15/PicoGamepadConverter), to figure out how to emulate HID gamepad through bluetooth properly.
